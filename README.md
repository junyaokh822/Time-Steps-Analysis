# Time and Steps Analysis for Algorithms | C++ README

This repository contains a program developed in C++ for analyzing the time complexity and step count of various algorithms. It includes implementations of a range of algorithms, including sorting algorithms such as Merge Sort and Selection Sort. The program also generates visualizations and charts to present the results and identify trends in algorithm performance.

## Getting Started

To get started with this program, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (e.g., GNU GCC)
- CMake (optional but recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/algorithm-analysis.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd algorithm-analysis
   ```

3. (Optional) Generate the build files using CMake:

   ```bash
   cmake -S . -B build
   ```

4. Compile the program:

   ```bash
   cmake --build build --target algorithm-analysis
   ```

## Usage

To use the program, follow the steps below:

1. Ensure you have compiled the program as described in the installation section.

2. Run the program:

   ```bash
   ./build/algorithm-analysis
   ```

3. The program will prompt you to choose an algorithm for analysis. Follow the on-screen instructions to select an algorithm.

4. Once the analysis is complete, the program will generate visualizations and charts displaying the time complexity and step count of the selected algorithm.
